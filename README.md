# A work in progress..

# Overview
Aims to provide a quick and light-weight solution for uploading location-tagged images and associating them with an event.  It came to my attention that after the Bostom bombing police were manually analyzing meta-data from images in order to locate where they were taken.  This simple app would have saved them a lot of time.  Though it's being developed with emergecy situations in mind, the Event model is generic and could just as easily be used for entertainment ie) concerts, festivals, etc.
